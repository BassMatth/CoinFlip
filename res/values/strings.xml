        \n\nA convenient way to flip a coin, even if you don\'t have one. 
        Simply tap the coin or shake and view the result. Tap the coin again 
        to reset.
        \n\nVerify the flip algorithm is truly pseudo-random by running the 
        Self Test and flipping the coin 10,000 times.
