A convenient way to flip a coin, even if you don't have one!

Simply tap the question mark or shake and view the result. Tap the coin again 
or shake to flip again. Verify the flip algorithm is truly pseudo-random by 
running the built-in Self Test and flipping the coin 10,000 times.

Completely FREE (no-ads) and doesn't require any unsafe permissions.
