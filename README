NOTICE:  Experimental Simple Coin Flip HD (SCFHD-BBRA) branch. 
         This branch contains an experimental port optimized for the
         BlackBerry Runtime for Android Apps.    

================================================================================

Completely FREE (no-ads) and doesn't require any unsafe permissions.

Simply tap the question mark or shake and view the result.  Tap the coin or 
shake to flip again. Spinning coin animation, sound, text, vibration, 
shake-to-flip and coin type are all configurable via the Settings menu.  Verify
the flip algorithm is truly random by running the built-in Self Test and 
flipping the coin 100,000 times while watching the results in real-time. 
(Sorry, no cheating!)  Add new coins from the Android Market by clicking 
Settings -> Get More Coins.

Open source app released under the GNU General Public License.

Currently supports both English and Spanish translations. Send me an e-mail if 
you would like to help translate this app into your native language.
